# Confluence knowledge graph

The idea is to have a query language based on a graph.
- Nodes (vertices) have attributes.
- Nodes have relationships (edges) that also have attributes
- Relationships can go to nodes of the same class

Node Classes:
- Text
  - content
  - published_at
  - updated_at
  - likes
- Entity
  - string
  - type
- Link
  - url
  - hypertext
  - domain
- Person
  - name
- DateRange
  - start_date
  - end_date
