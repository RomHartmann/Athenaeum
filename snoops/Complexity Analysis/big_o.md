## Big O in decreasing complexity:

O(n2)
    - Eg: Selection sort:  iterate through array for every element and set it as nth smallest element

O(n log n)
    - Eg: Quick sort: 
        - worst case is 

O(n)
    - Eg: Bucket sort: Create sorted list of all possible elements in the array

O(log n)
    - Eg: Binary search

O(1)
