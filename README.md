Athenaeum
---------

My own little private library of code, articles etc.


# article_archive

This is a long document with articles that I find interesting and want to keep.


# snoops

These are investigations of varying depth into some technology.


# side_projects

A place to put little personal side projects.  This can involve something I'm building
or just code I played around with for some reason.


# installed_repos

A place where I've installed some git repos that I've needed.


# miscellaneous

Small odds and ends that don't really fit anywhere else.
